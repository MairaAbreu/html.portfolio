<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a student of Information Systems at IFBA - Conquista. I hope to learn more and more to work as a full-stack</p>

  

<p>I am currently an IT intern at Col√©gio Sacramentinas, where I develop activities such as customer support in relation to the systems used at the school, I accompany students in the Computer Lab, I cover events by taking pictures, I make enrollments, etc. I still don't work with computer programming.</p>
